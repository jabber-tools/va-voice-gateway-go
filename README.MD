---

POC written in GO. Main purpose is to compare with Rust based version in terms of:

performance (CPU)

memory needs

SW design (ease of coding etc.)

## Go design patterns

## To check
- [ ] Best way how to write constructor method (return type X vs *X)
- [ ] Custom features + conditional compilation based on them. Possible?
